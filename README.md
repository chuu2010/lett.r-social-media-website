<h1>Lett.r : Our Philosophy</h1>
Why Lett.r?
<p>Lett.r is themed around letters where you can share letters with your penmates but it's online! With our y2k aesthetic, our UI gives you a fresh and new color palette.
Join and chat with your penmates or even make new ones!
Keep up to date with all the trending things and write to everyone all around the world <3</p>
